Anomaly detection is an important step of data cleaning. Although there exist a wide range of anomaly detection methods such as statistical outlier detection and integrity constraints based violation detection, it remains a hard problem about how to collaboratively apply and combine multiple (heterogeneous) anomaly detection methods upon a given dirty dataset. PEARL project intends to efficiently combine multiple anomaly detection methods with different paradigms to maximize the quality of the detection based on ensembling, transfer and active learning.
