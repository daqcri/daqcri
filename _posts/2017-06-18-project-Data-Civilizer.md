DATA CIVILIZER is collaboration between QCRI and MIT CSAIL to build an end-to-end big data management system to help data scientists 
(i) quickly discover datasets of interest from large numbers of tables; 
(ii) link relevant data sets; 
(iii) compute answers from the disparate data stores that host the discovered data sets; 
(iv) clean the desired data; and 
(v) iterate through these tasks using a workflow system, as data scientists often perform these tasks in different orders
